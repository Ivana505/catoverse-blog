# User Experience
## User Stories

- User Stories are made with an Agile approach. 

  - As a User I want to see comment box so I can comment blog article.
  - As a User I want to see a heart symbol so that I can like the post.
  - As a User I want to see register or sign up button so that I can create my account to be able to comment blog articles.
  - As a User I want to see a delete button on a comments page so that I can delete my comment if I want.
  - As a User I want to see the edit button so that I can edit my comment.
  - As a User I want to see more blog posts under one topic so I can learn more about cats.

Future development : Editing and deleting posts by the user, for now only available under Django Administration.
